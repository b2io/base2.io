      NetJets offers luxury clients the moon. One indulgence was missing,
      though: a sleek mobile app that lets them book flights, access
      high-speed internet from midair, and even control cabin temperature at
      the touch of a button."
        askText="When NetJetsâ€™ call center became overloaded with booking traffic, they
      realized a user-friendly app could reduce congestion and give customers more
      control over their flying experience. To lift the idea off the ground, the private
      jet charter company hired Base Two."
        solutionText="Although NetJets had an existing mobile app, it was only compatible
      with iOS and didnâ€™t serve much functional purpose. In less time and with a smaller
      budget than the original iOS build, our team created a new app that catered to both
      Android and iPhone users. The result was Fly NetJets, a React Native app that makes
      flight bookings easy and elegant."
