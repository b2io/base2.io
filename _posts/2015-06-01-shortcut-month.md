Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to improve your overall efficiency with your computer, but they can be difficult to commit to memory all at once. This month we will suggest a new shortcut each day that we find helpful in our day-to-day lives as front-end web developers. By learning a new shortcut each day you will be well on your way to living a mouse-free life.

<!-- #REST#BEGIN -->
### Preface

I do much of my day-to-day work on a Windows 7 machine using WebStorm, Visual Studio 2013, and Google Docs. As such, this list of keyboard shortcuts may not be as helpful to users of different platforms and software, though there are generally similar shortcuts available on those systems.

#### <a name="1"></a> 6/1 Move windows in Windows

I find the ability to manipulate the position of windows via the keyboard in Windows 7 as one of the greatest features the OS offers - yet many users somehow overlook this simple set of shortcuts. By holding the Windows key and using your keyboard arrow keys you'll no longer need your mouse to move the active window.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd> | Split left
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>right-arrow</kbd>| Split right
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>up-arrow</kbd>   | Maximize
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>up-down</kbd>    | Minimize

Also, if you have multiple monitors, you can move the window from monitor to monitor by continuing to click the left or right arrow key while holding down the Windows key.

#### <a name="2"></a> 6/2: Move that cursor

Until you learn these simple cursor management shortcuts you likely won't realize how much time you've wasted using your mouse to move the cursor and select words in word documents. Once these are committed to muscle memory you'll be able to type and edit documents like a pro.

You likely already know that the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor, and you may know that holding the shift key while arrowing allows you to select a character at a time. From there you simply need to remember that the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key can be used as a modifier to do things in larger chunks.

Left Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>left-arrow</kbd> | move cursor left
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd> | move cursor left to the beginning of the word
<kbd>home</kbd> | move cursor left to the beginning of the line
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>home</kbd> | move cursor to the beginning of the document (super-duper left)
<kbd>shift</kbd> + key combo | select text between cursor start and end point

Right Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>right-arrow</kbd> | move cursor right
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>right-arrow</kbd> | move cursor right to the end of the word
<kbd>end</kbd> | move cursor right to the end of the line
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>end</kbd> | move cursor to the end of the document (super-duper right)
<kbd>shift</kbd> + key combo | select text between cursor start and end point

#### <a name="3"></a> 6/3: Google Docs - Shortcut for everything

Have you ever been working in a Google Doc and wanted to add a numeric list (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd>), a bulleted list (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>8</kbd>), or perhaps center the text (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>)? You likely reached for your mouse and visually scanned the format bar for these features because it's too difficult to remember the individual shortcuts (or there isn't a shortcut at all as in the case of changing the font). Well, you're in luck. There's a single magical shortcut that does it all.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> | search the menu within Google Docs

This simple key combination allows you to search the menu options. So, if you want to change the font to "Courier New" you can hit <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>, type "cour", and hit enter. 

![Google Docs search menu](http://i.imgur.com/myyRI6w.png)

Generally the individual shortcut for each feature is still faster, but a shortcut that you can remember is better than one you cannot. Plus, when you use the <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> key combination it will show you the shortcut combination to the right of the option before you apply it - so you have a way to learn the more granular ones over time. If you'd like to learn all of the shortcut keys available in Google Docs there's a shortcut for that too: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>.

#### <a name="4"></a> 6/4: Super pasting powers

Often times adding <kbd>shift</kbd> to a keyboard shortcut changes or enhances the shortcut. Most people know that <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will paste whatever was copied to the clipboard, but many applications offer an enhanced paste with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> | Paste without formatting (Google Docs / Microsoft Word), Select from clipboard (Web Storm, Visual Studio)

In Google Docs and Microsoft Word using <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> acts as "paste special". This allows you to paste the clipboard contents in the document's format rather than the originally copied format. For example, if you copy bold Comic Sans text from a web page, and then paste into your Arial Google Doc with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>, it will paste in bold Comic Sans (which you clearly don't want because you're not a monster); however, if you were to paste with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> it will paste the text content from the website in the matching Arial font style and size.

In IDEs, such as Web Storm and Visual Studio, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> allows you to paste previously copied text. In Web Storm <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will provide a window to select which of the previously copied texts to paste. 

![WebStorm paste special](http://i.imgur.com/9a65jrl.png)

Visual Studio will progressively paste the next most recently copied item with each <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> click (while holding <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd>). In both applications <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will paste the most recently copied text.

Copy this post (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>) and give it a try!

#### <a name="5"></a> 6/5: Lock it down

Before heading out of the office for lunch (or just going to the bathroom) you should probably lock your computer. Rather than reaching for your mouse and meandering over to the start button, learn this simple shortcut.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> | Lock screen (in Windows)

<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> (l for lock) will immediately lock your Windows screen. 

Now you can go to the bathroom with the peace of mind that nobody will replace you <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Pull-a-Computer-Prank-on-Your-Friends" target="_blank">desktop background</a>.

#### <a name="6"></a> 6/6: Show me the Desktop

It's the weekend and you want to see that pretty desktop image of yours rather than all of the work-related applications and windows. Windows 7 has the nifty little feature that allows you to minimize everything and go straight to your desktop by clicking on the very bottom right of the screen, but that approach is for mouse-lovers, who we are not.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> | Show desktop (and minimize all windows) in Windows

<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> (d for desktop) will take you straight to your desktop without ever glancing at your mouse. If you want to bring all of your applications back up simply hit <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> again.

#### <a name="7"></a> 6/7: One-handed Browser Tab Management

At times you may find yourself browsing the web and you think of something different that you want to search for. Many people may click the "add tab" button toward the top of the browser, but that would require touching the mouse and moving it several millimeters up. With just your left hand you can quickly open a new tab and start typing your search.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> | Create new tab 
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> | Close tab or application (Browsers, Windows Explorer, and many other applications)
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> | Re-open closed tab
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> | Switch to next tab to the right 
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> | Switch to next tab to the left

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> will open a new tab in most browsers, and will place the focus in the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing your search (at least in Chrome, which is the browser you should be using). When you're done with the tab you can close it with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> (w for close?). 

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> will allow you to quickly switch to the tab to the right. Adding shift to the close or move right shortcuts will reverse their behavior thereby re-opening the closed tab or moving to the tab on the left (oh the magic of the shift key).

Now you're able to create, switch, and remove browser tabs all with just your left hand, which frees your right hand to throw your mouse across the room.

#### <a name="8"></a> 6/8: Spreadsheet Column/Row Selection

It's Monday and you're back to work. If you find yourself modifying spreadsheets for even a portion of the day then it's worthwhile learning some common shortcuts. Today we'll go over how to select columns and rows without using the mouse.

![Select column](http://i.imgur.com/x3gocRv.png)

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> | Select column (Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel)
<kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> | Select row (Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel)

In both Google Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to select the column of the active cell (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> for **C**olumn). This is helpful when you want to clear the contents of the column (by clicking <kbd>delete</kbd>), draw your attention to the column, or act on the column in some other way (we'll go over column insertion and removal in a future post). You can then use <kbd>shift</kbd> and arrow keys to select more columns.

If rows are more your thing then you can use <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to select a row (<kbd>shift</kbd> for "**S**ooo not a column").

#### <a name="9"></a> 6/9: Spreadsheet Column/Row Insert and Delete

With yesterday's shortcut you now know how to select a column or row in a spreadsheet. Now it's time to learn how to do two of the most popular spreadsheet actions: insertion and deletion.

Sadly this is an area where Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet shortcuts differ. We'll go over Excel shortcuts first.

Excel Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> | Add column(s) or row(s) above or to the left of the selected column(s) or row(s)
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> | Remove selected column(s) or row(s)

In Excel you first must select the column(s) or row(s) that you wish to act on. Then you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> to add columns or rows or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> to remove columns or rows. When adding columns or rows it inserts the same number of columns or rows that you have selected either left of the selected columns or above the selected rows.

Google Spreadsheet Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> | Add column(s) to the left of the selected column(s)
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> | Add row(s) above the selected row(s)
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> | Remove selected column(s) or row(s)

Since the column and row shortcuts found in Excel are already browser shortcuts used to zoom in and out (note: if you accidentally zoomed in or out you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> to return to 100%), Google had to come up with different, less obvious, shortcuts. It is not necessary to select the column or row before using the insertion shortcuts, but by selecting more than one column or row the insertion action will insert the number that is selected. 

The insertion shortcuts are <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> for "**I**nsert **C**olumn" and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> for "**I**nsert **R**ow". Column and row deletion is <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> for "**E**dit **D**elete".

#### <a name="10"></a> 6/10: Jump to the Address Bar

All too often users shift their mouse to the top of the screen simply to place their cursor in the browser address bar. Cut that bad habit with this simple shortcut.

![Browser address bar](http://i.imgur.com/wC5hjP9.png)

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> | Place cursor in address bar (all browsers and Windows Explorer)

When in a browser or Windows folder (Windows Explorer) pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> will place focus in the address bar, and highlight the contents of the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing. This is also helpful when you want to copy the address of the page you are on via <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>. 

**Pro tip:** Add a <kbd>?</kbd> at the beginning of you address bar to force a Google search rather than it potentially being treated as a url as is the case when you search for "asp.net".

#### <a name="11"></a> 6/11: Switch Active Windows

This one is an oldie and a goodie. Many people already know and use this shortcut without even thinking about it, but for anybody who doesn't already know how to switch between applications this shortcut is a life changer.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> | Switch between open applications and windows

If you have multiple applications open you can switch between them with <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> rather than clicking on the taskbar icons with your mouse. Using this keyboard combination will switch you to the most recently used application. If you press the combination again it will switch you back. If you press <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> but keep holding down the <kbd>alt</kbd> key you will see a list of the applications to switch between, and while holding <kbd>alt</kbd> it will switch the selected application for each press of the <kbd>tab</kbd> key.

#### <a name="12"></a> 6/12: Back and Forward Navigation

When browsing the web you will inevitably need to navigate backward - whether it's to get back to your search results or to return to an embarrassingly <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/OQbVc*b-KB9N8WhlPa*p43ZhR5D2*6BzUXEABZ-BvbE*si9pe31-k6QHTC6RP0wiV1YKvbHXTJCadfhxHgVI9CDC4JZ*vNiK/cutedog1920x1200.jpg" target="_blank">cute picture</a> that you stumbled upon. You're in luck - there's a shortcut for that.

![Browser navigation](http://i.imgur.com/VMZT1KD.png)

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd> | Navigate back in browsers and Windows Explorer
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>right-arrow</kbd> | Navigate forward in browsers and Windows Explorer

Using <kbd>alt</kbd> and you're left and right arrow keys you can navigate your browser history like a pro. This also works with Windows Explorer so you can quickly open folders and navigate back all day. Note that <kbd>backspace</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> will also navigate backward / forward assuming you're focus isn't in an input field, but the <kbd>alt</kbd> key approach is convenient because it always works.

#### <a name="13"></a> 6/13: Facebook Stream Navigation

I'm sure you don't use Facebook at work, but now that it's the weekend it's fair game. There's a better way to scroll through your stream than using the mouse or arrow keys.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>j</kbd> | Scroll to next post (Facebook, Google+, various other sites)
<kbd>k</kbd> | Scroll to previous post (Facebook, Google+, various other sites)

Using the <kbd>j</kbd> key you can scroll down your social stream while sipping on your weekend <a href="https://eytanuliel.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/giant-margarita.jpg" target="_blank">margarita</a>. If you skipped past something interesting click <kbd>k</kbd>. Be careful that you don't have focus in an input field otherwise you're going to have a pretty funny status update (jjjjjkjkjjk).

#### <a name="14"></a> 6/14: Browser Refresh

Web developers refresh their browser approximately 1337 times a day, but even the average user occasionally needs to refresh. 

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> | Refresh the browser
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> | Refresh the browser ignoring cache (Chrome, Firefox)

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> will refresh the browser as if you clicked the browser refresh button. Chrome and Firefox also provide <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>, which will reload the page and all of the assets rather than relying on cached data. This comes in handy when you're a web developer troubleshooting a problem. 

Note that <kbd>F5</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> perform the same refresh and refresh ignoring cache actions, but they're a bit more of a finger stretch.

#### <a name="15"></a> 6/15: Folder and File Browsing

The most common (and slowest) way to browse folders and files is to double click on My Computer, and then begin clicking and scrolling folders. Using a few keyboard shortcuts will get you where you want to be in a snap.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> | Opens Windows Explorer (the equivalent of double clicking "My Computer")
<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> | Opens the Run window

If you like starting at "My Computer" (labeled as just "Computer" in Windows 7) then <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> is your new best friend. It opens the Computer directory up immediately so that you can begin to navigate the folders. 

![My computer](http://i.imgur.com/johmmCX.png)

Folders can be navigated quickly by arrowing down/up to the folder you wish to open and then clicking <kbd>enter</kbd>. If you're staring at a long list of folders then you can jump quickly to the folder you want by beginning to type the name of the folder. If you've opened a folder by accident you can use the <a href="#12">navigate back shortcut</a> that we learned previously (<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd>). When you're done navigating you can close the folder with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> as we learned in <a href="#7">One-handed Browser Tab Management</a>.

If you prefer to start at a different folder than Computer you can use the run command <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> and then type the folder you want to jump to (such as c:/windows), and the click <kbd>enter</kbd>.

#### <a name="16"></a> 6/16: Rename Folder or File

Yesterday you learned how to navigate folders and files without a mouse, but if you wanted to rename one of those folders or files you would still need to right click with your mouse. No more! Today we learn the simple shortcut that allows for renaming.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>F2</kbd> | Rename file in Windows Explorer, edit cell in Microsoft Excel

Yes, the function keys in the great north of your keyboard do have a purpose. When browsing files and folders clicking <kbd>F2</kbd> will put the selected folder or file in rename mode with the full name already selected. Therefore if you want to fully rename the folder or file you can just start typing. If, instead, you only wanted to modify the name then after hitting <kbd>F2</kbd> hit <kbd>arrow-right</kbd> to remove the highlight.

#### <a name="17"></a> 6/17: New Browser Window

Occasionally you want a new browser window rather than a new tab - especially if you plan to split screen or you are using multiple monitors. Before you drag that new tab out of the window learn this shortcut.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> | Open new window (Browsers, Windows Explorer, varios applications)
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> | Open new icognito window (Chrome)

Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> to open a new window (**n** for **N**ew window). This shortcut works similarly in various other applications. For instance, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> will create a new document in Word and a new tab in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>.

![Chrome incognito](http://i.imgur.com/AI7u4Ek.png)

If you're feeling a little sneakier you open a new Icognito window in Chrome via <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>. Icognito mode allows your to browse without storing history, cookies, etc. This is helpful if you're doing web development or if you're buying your significant other a surprise gift.

#### <a name="18"></a> 6/18: Find What You're Looking For

When you're looking for a specific term on a web page or document the application's search functionality can be a savior, but ironically the search functionality can be difficult to find. Stop searching for the search so that you can begin searching with these shortcuts.

![My computer](http://i.imgur.com/gTzjt7w.png)

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> | Opens find in most applications and Windows Explorer
<kbd>F3</kbd> | Find next in most applications
<kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F3</kbd> | Find previous in most applications

Next time there is a term you want to search for simply press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> to be placed in the application's search form. You can then generally begin typing your search (you may need to hit enter to submit it). If there are multiple results you can go to the next result with <kbd>F3</kbd>, and if you accidentally pass what you were looking for you can search backward with <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F3</kbd>.

#### <a name="19"></a> 6/19: Start with the Win Key

Coming soon...
