We've let our blog languish for a long time now -- while talking about the reasons behind that, one thing that kept coming up is that it didn't seem like it was part of our normal workflow. In an attempt to remedy some of that, we've switched over from [Blogger](http://blogger.com) to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) (via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)).<!-- #REST#BEGIN --> Below are a few of the advantages we've found so far:

* Complete control over the presentation.
* Familiar (git style) workflow (branch, write, test, merge, push).
* Dead-simple local testing with <code>jekyll --server</code>.
* Free, reliable hosting on Github.

So far, the experience has been great. We're actually _excited_ about writing new posts now. And hey, we've posted again so that's good... right?
