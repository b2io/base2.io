    <h1>Hello, we&rsquo;re Base Two</h1>

    <p>We design and develop projects for web, mobile and desktop environments. We work with businesses, big and small, to turn their ideas into beautiful, functional technology.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Web</h2>

    <p>We create rich user experiences and the back-end services to support them. Our expertise in full-stack web development means we can realize your vision from start to finish. Our work includes enterprise software, e-commerce solutions, websites and web applications. Whether you are looking to start a new project or trying to finish an existing one, we have the chops to get it done.</p>

    <h2>Mobile</h2>

    <p>The smartphone and tablet market is growing exponentially. Android and iOS dominate the market, but other players are still relevant. So, which mobile operating system are you going to target? We use Phonegap:Build to eliminate that dilemma for you. We write code once and deploy to every major mobile OS. If your end-user has a mobile device, you've got an app for it.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>We do user-centric, interaction-driven design. We assess your targeted user base and determine the most effective way to structure your content. We iterate using wireframes and click-through prototypes until it works just right, and then we make it look like a million bucks. Need to update your brand? We do that, too.</p>

      <h1>Our Process</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Requirements Gathering</h2>

    <p>The first step to solving a problem is understanding it. We put a huge emphasis on understanding our clients&rsquo; work. For us, requirements gathering isn&rsquo;t just a phase at the beginning of the project, it is an ongoing process. We are always working to better understand our clients&rsquo; business needs and converting those needs into user stories and project milestones.</p>

    <h2>UX/UI</h2>

    <p>Great code is useless without great user interface design. Base Two delivers both.</p>

    <p>We start by creating user stories to get a firm understanding of how your average user works and to tease out any hidden interaction requirements. Then we audit your content, optimizing it for web and mobile interfaces and organizing it so your users can navigate intuitively and effectively.</p>

    <p>The resulting Information Architecture (IA) forms the foundation for the structure of the project. We use iterative wireframes and Rapid Prototyping (RP) to mock up and then fine-tune the user flow. Once the application flow is just right, we skin the wireframes, producing a beautiful, usable design.</p>

    <h2>Agile Development</h2>

    <p>At Base Two, we manage projects differently. We follow a software development discipline known as the Agile Method, a philosophy acknowledges that requirements and solutions evolve throughout the project lifecycle. With Agile, we divide the project scope into many small milestones with clear, concise goals. The result? Our customers begin receiving deliverables in the first weeks of development, get an earlier return on investment, and are never out of the loop.</p>

    <h2>Test Driven Development</h2>

    <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology we use to ensure that our software meets user requirements, and that it continues to meet the requirements as new features are introduced. For each new feature, we write an initially failing test, develop the feature until the test passes and then refactor the code for optimization and maintenance. With TDD, every feature has associated tests explaining exactly how the code should function, so the verification TDD provides also serves as documentation for the application.</p>

    <h2>ScopeBuilder</h2>

    <p>We worked with AEP to express one of their bread-and-butter engineering processes: scoping and ordering of equipment for transmission projects. During discovery, AEP learned that they would benefit substantially from a reporting system that could satisfy queries like: How many Drop-In Control Modules are they installing this summer? [Another question]? Which engineer or engineering group most frequently places costly, non-standard orders?</p>

    <p>We built ScopeBuilder with the modern client-side Javascript framework, Backbone.js, on an ASP .NET back-end. By deploying weekly builds to a cloud-service using Heroku and Azure, we eliminated the need for client-provided infrastructure support, getting each week&rsquo;s deliverable directly into the client&rsquo;s hands.</p>

    <h2>TSV</h2>

    <p>AEP needed help. Engineers were completing and filing maintenance reports manually, effectively forfeiting all opportunity to gain institutional knowledge from their projects. Working with
      <abbr title="Protection and Control Engineering"
          class="initialism">PCE</abbr> team to describe every facet of their process, we transformed their manual reporting process into a modern web application on a Ruby on Rails server.
    </p>

    <p>We weren&rsquo;t thrown when the client&rsquo;s technological needs suddenly changed from Rails to ASP.NET during development. Because we built the web application to be platform agnostic, we could seamlessly integrate it with any client-side services technology.</p>

    <p>This means that while our ASP.NET expert was building a brand-new set of services for the application, our UI Developer was free to work on implementing new features. For our team and our client, what could have easily become a major roadblock was nothing more than a minor bump in the road.</p>

    <h2>Nature&rsquo;s One Mobile</h2>

    <p>Nature&rsquo;s One, the leader in organic pediatric medical nutrition, came to Base Two to build an eCommerce solution and a mobile application after a previous vendor failed to deliver. We used Magento (built in PHP with the Zend Framework) for the eCommerce back-end and jQuery Mobile with Phonegap to deploy a gorgeous, streamlined mobile store to Android, iOS, and Windows Phone from a single codebase.</p>

    <h2>KJM Products &ndash; Application Prototype</h2>

    <p>For a startup seeking venture capital, money is tight and timing is crucial. KJM Products approached us with an idea for a product that we estimated would take 6 weeks to implement. That didn&rsquo;t work for our client--they needed a working version sooner. By working with KLM to identify a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that could be presented to stakeholders sooner, we whittled the project estimate down from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. The application was written in web languages, styled with JQuery Mobile and compiled for iOS and Android through PhoneGap.</p>
