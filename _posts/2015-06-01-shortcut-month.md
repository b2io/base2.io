Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to improve your overall efficiency with your computer, but they can be difficult to commit to memory all at once. This month we will suggest a new shortcut each day that we find helpful in our day-to-day lives as front-end web developers. By learning a new shortcut each day you will be well on your way to living a mouse-free life.

<!-- #REST#BEGIN -->
### Preface

I do much of my day-to-day work on a Windows 7 machine using WebStorm, Visual Studio 2013, and Google Docs. As such, this list of keyboard shortcuts may not be as helpful to users of different platforms and software, though there are generally similar shortcuts available on those systems.

#### <a name="1"></a> 6/1 Move windows in Windows

I find the ability to manipulate the position of windows via the keyboard in Windows 7 as one of the greatest features the OS offers - yet many users somehow overlook this simple set of shortcuts. By holding the Windows key and using your keyboard arrow keys you'll no longer need your mouse to move the active window.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`win + left-arrow` | Split left
`win + right-arrow`| Split right
`win + up-arrow`   | Maximize
`win + up-down`    | Minimize

Also, if you have multiple monitors, you can move the window from monitor to monitor by continuing to click the left or right arrow key while holding down the Windows key.

#### <a name="2"></a> 6/2: Move that cursor

Until you learn these simple cursor management shortcuts you likely won't realize how much time you've wasted using your mouse to move the cursor and select words in word documents. Once these are committed to muscle memory you'll be able to type and edit documents like a pro.

You likely already know that the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor, and you may know that holding the shift key while arrowing allows you to select a character at a time. From there you simply need to remember that the `ctrl` key can be used as a modifier to do things in larger chunks.

Left Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`left-arrow` | move cursor left
`ctrl + left-arrow` | move cursor left to the beginning of the word
`home` | move cursor left to the beginning of the line
`ctrl + home` | move cursor to the beginning of the document (super-duper left)
`shift` + key combo | select text between cursor start and end point

Right Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`right-arrow` | move cursor right
`ctrl + right-arrow` | move cursor right to the end of the word
`end` | move cursor right to the end of the line
`ctrl + end` | move cursor to the end of the document (super-duper right)
`shift` + key combo | select text between cursor start and end point

#### <a name="3"></a> 6/3: Google Docs - Shortcut for everything

Have you ever been working in a Google Doc and wanted to add a numeric list (`ctrl + shift + 7)`, a bulleted list (`ctrl + shift + 8)`, or perhaps center the text (`ctrl + shift + E`)? You likely reached for your mouse and visually scanned the format bar for these features because it's too difficult to remember the individual shortcuts (or there isn't a shortcut at all as in the case of changing the font). Well, you're in luck. There's a single magical shortcut that does it all.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`alt + /` | search the menu within Google Docs

This simple key combination allows you to search the menu options. So, if you want to change the font to "Courier New" you can hit `alt + /`, type "cour", and hit enter.

Generally the individual shortcut for each feature is still faster, but a shortcut that you can remember is better than one you cannot. Plus, when you use the `alt + /` key combination it will show you the shortcut combination to the right of the option before you apply it - so you have a way to learn the more granular ones over time. If you'd like to learn all of the shortcut keys available in Google Docs there's a shortcut for that too: `ctrl + /`.

#### <a name="4"></a> 6/4: Super pasting powers

Often times adding `shift` to a keyboard shortcut changes or enhances the shortcut. Most people know that `ctrl+v` will paste whatever was copied to the clipboard, but many applications offer an enhanced paste with `ctrl+shift+v`.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`ctrl + shift + v` | Paste without formatting (Google Docs / Microsoft Word), Select from clipboard (Web Storm, Visual Studio)

In Google Docs and Microsoft Word using `ctrl+shift+v` acts as "paste special". This allows you to paste the clipboard contents in the document's format rather than the originally copied format. For example, if you copy bold Comic Sans text from a web page, and then paste into your Arial Google Doc with `ctrl+v`, it will paste in bold Comic Sans (which you clearly don't want because you're not a monster); however, if you were to paste with `ctrl+shift+v` it will paste the text content from the website in the matching Arial font style and size.

In IDEs, such as Web Storm and Visual Studio, `ctrl+shift+v` allows you to paste previously copied text. In Web Storm `ctrl+shift+v` will provide a window to select which of the previously copied texts to paste.

Visual Studio will progressively paste the next most recently copied item with each `ctrl+shift+v` click (while holding `ctrl+shift`). In both applications `ctrl+v` will paste the most recently copied text.

Copy this post (`ctrl+c`) and give it a try!

#### <a name="5"></a> 6/5: Lock it down

Before heading out of the office for lunch (or just going to the bathroom) you should probably lock your computer. Rather than reaching for your mouse and meandering over to the start button, learn this simple shortcut.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`win + l` | Lock screen (in Windows)

`win + l` (l for lock) will immediately lock your Windows screen. 

Now you can go to the bathroom with the peace of mind that nobody will replace you <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Pull-a-Computer-Prank-on-Your-Friends" target="_blank">desktop background</a>.


#### <a name="6"></a> 6/6: Show me the Desktop

It's the weekend and you want to see that pretty desktop image of yours rather than all of the work-related applications and windows. Windows 7 has the nifty little feature that allows you to minimize everything and go straight to your desktop by clicking on the very bottom right of the screen, but that approach is for mouse-lovers, who we are not.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`win + d` | Show desktop (and minimize all windows) in Windows

`win + d` (d for desktop) will take you straight to your desktop without ever glancing at your mouse. If you want to bring all of your applications back up simply hit `win + d` again.
