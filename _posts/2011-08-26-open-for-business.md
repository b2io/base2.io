Developing interactive experiences is our passion. We leverage Flash, Flex, AIR, and HTML5 to deliver engaging content for the web and desktop, tablets and mobile devices, kiosks and digital signage. Our attention to detail and deep understanding of software architecture and best practices enables us to consistently deliver for our clients.

We take a lot of pride in our work. We also take a lot of pride in where we work. Our offices are located at ~~1158 Corrugated Way~~ (our new location is 21 E. 5th Ave #102, Columbus, OH 43201), in the brand-new tech wing of the Columbus Idea Foundry, our business development partner. The Columbus Idea Foundry is Columbus’s own community workshop, DIY learning center, creative space, and small business incubator. We are very excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with The Columbus Idea Foundry and its member businesses.

We are always looking for opportunities to make creative, interactive content. If you would like to contact us, send us an email at [info@base2.io](mailto:info@base2.io) or call us at (614) 636-0003.
